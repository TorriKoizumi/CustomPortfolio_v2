                <p>Naos creates quality time with quality design, building personalized in-home terrariums that become sanctuaries. Using handpicked plants grown in a private greenhouse, they guarantee that you will be surrounded by fresh and healthy flora that will soothe the mind. I wanted to develop a brand identity that communicated the relaxed, quality, and hardworking attributes of the company. </p>

                <p>With a company revolving around relaxation as the focus, the brand touchpoints relied on the user experience as much as the visual design; this didn’t just apply to the digital mediums, but to the print as well.</p>
                    
                <p>Naos (ney-os) is a Greek word that refers to the innermost chamber of a temple, it is a place for solitude. I wanted to keep the logo simple to convey that brand value and decided to focus on finding a typeface for a logotype. I assembled a group of four serif typefaces that fit the Naos vision best, narrowed them down until Garamond Premier Pro was the only font remaining. After a few kerning adjustments I stepped back and was pleased with the new logotype.</p>

                <p>Throughout the exploration of the brand, it was clear that they love habanero peppers. It is an integral ingredient in their sauce and I thought that it should be the focus of the brand itself. 
                After a bunch of sketches and crumpled post-its, I arrived at this final design. I thought that the active volcano in place of the habanero core was a clever solution to combining the two focuses of the brand.

            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <p>The original website needed a major remodel. The main things I noticed: the sitemap was confusing, the hero page didn’t showcase the product, and there seemed to be a lack of organization in general. I liked that the company didn’t take themselves too seriously and included a “how to use” page. I wanted to keep that playfulness alive in the redesign so I added cartoon smoke outlines in the background. I also added the pop of orange to mimic the pop of heat coming from the hot sauce.
