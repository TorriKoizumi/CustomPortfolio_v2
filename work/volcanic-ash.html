                <p>In this project, I took a company who’s brand could have used a facelift, and reworked it from the ground up. This includes the Logo, Website, and Packaging. (Though I didn’t touch the hot sauce recipe!)

                <p>Introduction and short summary of this project. This is a sample portfolio entry project page. This
                    can be as simple as a bunch of images stacked or as complex as a detailed case study.</p>

            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <p>Born from a memory, Volcanic Ash is a small business based in New Hampshire with an obsession with re-creating a Mexican style sauce from a time past. With gloves and gasmasks donned, this team strives to bring the flavor that will kick your ash.</p>

        <h3 class="subheader">Goal</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <p>The intent of this project was to modernise the brand, simplify the UI, and to create an impression that reaches new customers. I wanted to make a hot sauce brand that I would buy.
                </p>

        <h3 class="subheader">Logo</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <p>Throughout the exploration of the brand, it was clear that they love habanero peppers. It is an integral ingredient in their sauce and I thought that it should be the focus of the brand itself. 
                <img src="../img/placeholder-1x1-laptop.jpg" alt="Sketches and final versions of the logo" class="scale-with-grid" />
                After a bunch of sketches and crumpled post-its, I arrived at this final design. I thought that the active volcano in place of the habanero core was a clever solution to combining the two focuses of the brand.

        <h3 class="subheader">Website</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <p>The original website needed a major remodel. The main things I noticed: the sitemap was confusing, the hero page didn’t showcase the product, and there seemed to be a lack of organization in general. I liked that the company didn’t take themselves too seriously and included a “how to use” page. I wanted to keep that playfulness alive in the redesign so I added cartoon smoke outlines in the background. I also added the pop of orange to mimic the pop of heat coming from the hot sauce.
