        <h1>City of Honolulu’s Flag Redesign</h1>

                <div class="two-thirds column">
                    <p>The City of Honolulu’s flag desperately needs a redesign. According to the official flag nerds at Nava, a good flag should: be simple, use meaningful symbolism, use two to three basic colors, not include lettering or seals, and it should be distinctive. Our flag fails 3 out of 5 rules at the least.

            <div class="row">
                <p>My flag showcases a yellow pineapple on a red background; these colors were chosen due to their relation to ancient Hawaiian royalty. The pineapple itself is broken up into 6 sections which represent the original 6 territories of Oahu. Lastly, there are seven leaves atop the pineapple which represent the 7 Kings of Hawaii, but there are also leaves below in the shape of a crown which represent Queen Lili’uokalani who was usurped from her throne.</p>
