        <h1>Torri Koizumi</h1>
        <p>Aloha, I’m a local boy born and raised in Kaneohe who is passionate about art and graphic design. In particular, I love advertisements and packaging design because of the powerful effect they can have on the public. I was introduced to the world of design as a freshman in highschool, where a buddy of mine showed me his favorite font. Fonts led to posters, posters led to 3d modeling, and 3d modeling led me to the rest. I am currently enrolled at Kapiʻolani Community College where I am learning more about my passion in the New Media Arts program. My main hobby is bodyboarding, but I also love hiking, running, and playing video games.</p>
